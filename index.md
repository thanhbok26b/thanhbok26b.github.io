I am a master student at the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/). I am also a member of the [Modelling, Simulation and Optimization Laboratory](http://mso.soict.hust.edu.vn/) and am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/). My current work focus on Memetic Optimization Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning.
